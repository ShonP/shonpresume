## Introduction

One of the most common questions I get from clients is: "Where should I invest my money for the long term?" My answer is almost always the same - **S&P 500**.

<Callout type="info">
The S&P 500 is an index representing the 500 largest companies in the US, comprising about 80% of the American stock market's total value.

## Historical Returns

Let's look at the data. The following chart shows the growth of a $10,000 investment over the years:

<ChartArea 
  data={[
    { name: "2016", value: 10000 },
    { name: "2017", value: 12200 },
    { name: "2018", value: 11700 },
    { name: "2019", value: 15400 },
    { name: "2020", value: 18200 },
    { name: "2021", value: 23400 },

## Why Not Try to "Time" the Market?

Research shows again and again that **market timing doesn't work**. Here's a comparison of different strategies:

<ChartBar
  data={[
    { name: "Continuous Investment", returns: 11.2 },
    { name: "Market Timing", returns: 6.8 },
    { name: "Cash Panic", returns: 4.2 },
    { name: "Bank Deposits", returns: 1.5 }

## Balanced Portfolio Composition

For most people, I recommend a simple portfolio composition:

<ChartPie
  data={[
    { name: "US Stocks", value: 60 },
    { name: "International Stocks", value: 20 },
    { name: "Bonds", value: 15 },
    { name: "Real Estate", value: 5 }
