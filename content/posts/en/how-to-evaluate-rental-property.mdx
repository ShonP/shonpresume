## Introduction

Purchasing a rental property is one of the most significant investments you'll make in your life. In this post, I'll teach you the accepted methods for property valuation.

## Important Metrics

### 1. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)

<Callout type="success">
**Formula**: Cap Rate = (Net Annual Income / Property Price) × 100
</Callout>

Here's a comparison of average yields in different US markets:

    { name: "Midwest", rate: 7.2 },
    { name: "Texas", rate: 6.1 },
    { name: "Florida", rate: 5.4 },
    { name: "California", rate: 4.2 },
    { name: "New York", rate: 3.8 }
  ]}

### 2. Cash Flow

The following chart shows projected cash flow for a $200,000 property investment:

    { name: "Year 1", cashflow: 5600 },
    { name: "Year 2", cashflow: 5880 },
    { name: "Year 3", cashflow: 6174 },
    { name: "Year 4", cashflow: 6483 },
    { name: "Year 5", cashflow: 6807 },
    { name: "Year 6", cashflow: 7147 },
    { name: "Year 7", cashflow: 7505 },
    { name: "Year 8", cashflow: 7880 },
    { name: "Year 9", cashflow: 8274 },
    { name: "Year 10", cashflow: 8687 }
  ]}

## Expense Breakdown

It's important to understand the expense structure before buying:

<ChartPie
  data={[
    { name: "Taxes", value: 25 },
    { name: "Maintenance", value: 15 },
    { name: "Insurance", value: 10 },
    { name: "HOA/Mgmt", value: 8 },
    { name: "Vacancy", value: 12 },
    { name: "Net Profit", value: 30 }
  ]}
  dataKey="value"
/>

## Practical Tips

<Callout type="warning">
**Remember**: Always plan for the pessimistic scenario. What happens if the property sits vacant for 3 months?
</Callout>

1. **Check the history** - Who lived there before? Why did they leave?
2. **Know the tenants** - Good tenants are worth more than high yield
3. **Think about exit** - Will you be able to sell the property easily?

## Summary

Evaluating a rental property requires deep analysis, not just looking at the price. If you're considering purchasing an investment property, I'd be happy to help you analyze the deal.
